My name is Thomas and I am the developer of RsyncUI and RsyncOSX. The development of RsyncOSX commenced in January 2016 as a personal project to learn Swift. And I am still learning, every day. The first version of RsyncOSX was released in March 2016 and there has been a lot of releases and changes since then. And the focus in 2021 is SwiftUI.

I do hold a degree in computing science, but I am **not a professional developer**. For the moment I am a senior advicer at a university. I will, early in 2022 at the age of 62, retire from work. I am granddad to three young ones, and the fourth grandkid will come later in 2021.

RsyncUI is not a professional software. There is only one developer, me, and I am doing what I can to keep RsyncUI as stable and userfriendly as possible. I am not a UI designer and some user might find the UI of RsyncUI complicated and less userfriendly.

The development of RsyncUI will continue to be one of my prioritized hobbies. A long as there are users of it I will continue developing.  If you like using RsyncUI please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.
