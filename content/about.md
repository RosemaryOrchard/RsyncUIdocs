My name is Thomas and I am the developer of RsyncUI, RsyncGUI, RsyncOSX and RsyncOSXsched. The development of RsyncOSX commenced in January 2016 as a personal project to learn Swift. And I am still learning, every day. The first version of RsyncOSX was released in March 2016 and there has been a lot of changes since then.

I do hold a degree in computing science, but I am **not a professional developer**. For the moment I am a senior employee (administration) at a university. I have decided for early retirement in 2022. Granddad to three young ones, and the fourth grandkid will come later in 2021. RsyncUI is not a professional software. There is only one developer, me, and I am doing what I can to keep RsyncUI as stable and userfriendly as possible. I am not a UI designer and some user might find the UI of RsyncUI complicated and less userfriendly.

The development of RsyncUI will continue to be one of my prioritized hobbies. A long as there are users of it I will continue developing.  If you like using RsyncUI please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.

## Applications

There are four MacOS applications, one SwiftUI based and the three other Swift and Storyboard based.

### SwiftUI based

- [RsyncUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI) a GUI for rsync

This app is compiled for **macOS Big Sur** only.

### Swift and Storyboards

- [RsyncOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX) a GUI for rsync
- [The menuapp](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSXsched) for executing scheduled tasks in RsyncOSX and RsyncUI
- [RsyncGUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncGUI) an Apple Sandboxed version of RsyncOSX

The three last applications are compiled with support for macOS 10.15 - latest version of macOS.
