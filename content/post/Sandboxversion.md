Later in 2021 there will developed and released a Sandboxed version of RsyncUI for release on Apple Mac Store.

The [App Sandboxing technology](https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/) is a technology for protecting the user for malicious software. To release a macOS app on Apple Mac App Store require the app to execute inside a Sandbox. Compared to the signed and notarized version of RsyncUI there will be a few limitations. A Sandboxed macOS application is not allowed to execute other versions of rsync than the [default version](/post/rsync/).
