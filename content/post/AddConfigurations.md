After adding or changed a task please verify the result by executing an estimation run.

The following actions within this view:

- `Add` - will add a new configuration
- `Update` - the `Add` button will change when a configuration is selected

Just press the Enter key will automatically enter a new task. The Enter key will advance to next field. If the local catalog and remote catalog are local attached catalogs the Enter key will automatically add it after the Synchronize ID.

### Task
