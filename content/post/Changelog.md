There are a few significant changes in the updated SwiftUI 3 and macOS 12, please see more info about [changes in RsyncUI on macOS 12](/post/macos12/).

The builds are considered as beta versions even if version number is greater than one. The builds are stable and they are working. But the UI needs some more polish and QA, and the next version is 1.2.0(build xx) when macOS Monterey is released. The betas, version 1.1.2(build xx), will be updated when there are new updates in code.

## Version 1.1.2(build 32) - updated 20 July 2021

New [build](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) for public beta of MacOS Monterey, build by Xcode 13 beta 3. There is still some issues with localization, builds are English only.

The build for macOS Big Sur is **removed**, there are many changes in Xcode 13, SwiftUI 3 and macOS Monterey compared to current official releases from Apple

The macOS Monterey version includes enhancements only available for macOS Monterey.
- the buttons and togge buttons are changed
- the multiple tasks and single tasks view buttons for estimate and execute are "cleaned up"
  - in both views select the execute button executes the task(s) in one go
  - or estimate, view estimate and then execute
- the schedules view is changed as well
  - it is required some more QA on the schedules
- the log views and filter logs are updated, both all logs and by configuration
- and some internal stuff refactored

The QA and cleanup of UI continues on the road to release on macOS Monterey.

## Version 1.1.2(build 28)

There is 29 June 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) version 1.1.2 of RsyncUI. There are two builds, one for macOS Big Sur and one for macOS Monterey.

At start of the macOS Big Sur version select, from the drop down, either the "Default profile" or other profile if used. This is **not** required on RsyncUI on macOS Monterey. RsyncUI on macOS Monterey picks the default profile when selecting a task.

- RsyncUI conforms [the App protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app)
- the UI is cleaned up a bit
- several internal changes
- RsyncUI adapts to some changes in macOS settings, see link about [RsyncUI on macOS Monterey](/post/macos12/)

The localization of RsyncUI is somewhat refactored. For the moment RsyncUI is localized to German and Norwegian, and there are a few strings missing in the release candidate. See more info about localization in [RsyncUI on macOS Monterey](/post/macos12/).

## Version 1.1.1(build 27)

**Update 17 June 2021**. The builds are removed for the moment.

There is 4 June 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) version 1.1.1 of RsyncUI. The following is fixed in this release:

- refactored parts of decode and encode JSON, Combine is a super framework
- refactored a few other parts as well
- SwiftUI require some computed properties, like UUID, on data
  - these properties are added during reading data, by mistake these properties was also written to file
  - this is now fixed and the filesize, specially the logs file, is reduced
- existing users of RsyncOSX using defalt format for storing data (PLIST) now can use RsyncUI to [transform default PLIST data](/post/plist/) to JSON which is required in RsyncUI

## Version 1.1.0(build 26)

There is 21 May 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) version 1.1.0 of RsyncUI. The following is fixed in this release:

- after a delete of a profile, reload of existing profile names
- a minor update in UI for post and pretask (clearing the input fields)
- more internals using the Combine framework, check about [Combine in development details](/post/developmentdetails/#combine)
- some cleaning up and minor refactor
- a minor bug in executing shell scripts
- updates to [the UI for adding and updating Configuration](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/addconfigurations/)
- updates to [the UI for adding shell scripts](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/shellout/)

## Version 1.0.1(build 24)

There is 12 May 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) version 1.0.1 of RsyncUI and RsyncSchedule.

The following are changes compared to previous releases:

  - the issue with snapshots and remote catalogs is solved
  - save plan and day on a snapshot task
  - delete old snapshots
- a few minor cleanups and enhancements in the UI part

## Version 1.0.0(build 23)

There is 06 May 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) version 1.0.0 of RsyncUI and RsyncSchedule, the menu app for executing scheduled tasks. The **snapshot administration**, like delete old snapshots, is still not yet completed. The work on snapshot administration is going forward and it will be released as an update of RsyncUI. But there are a few issues which has to be resolved before release.

The following are changes compared to previous releases:

- German and Norwegian localizations are updated
- even more use of the Combine framework
- a few internal updates and UI updates

Issue: there is an issue, in Snapshots, selecting a snapshot task and collecting remote data for snapshotcatalogs. The UI will notify if it seems to be such an issue.

About **JSON**: see note on the release 0.99.

## Prerelease version 0.99(build 22)

There is 28 April 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) a release candidate of RsyncUI and RsyncSchedule, the menu app for executing scheduled tasks.

The following are changes compared to previous release:

- German and Norwegian localization is completed
- more use of the Combine framework
- split two "busy" UIs into two views, schedules and rsync parameters
- some minor tweaks in preparation for release of version 1.0.0

**Caution**: RsyncUI can be used in **parallel with RsyncOSX**. But that requires **RsyncOSX** to be setup to use **JSON files** and that the files for permanent storage is in the same catalog as RsyncUI. RsyncUI and RsyncOSX does **not** share the user settings.

There is some more info about [how to setup RsyncOSX utilizing JSON](https://rsyncosx.netlify.app/post/json/). The `About` for both RsyncOSX and RsyncUI shows in bottom of view, where the data is saved. Default catalog for storing files for both apps is:

```bash
$HOME/.rsyncosx/macserialnumber/
```
