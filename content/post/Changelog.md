The prerelease is a version **for test and preview of what is coming**. It is work in progress and bugs might occur. RsyncUI is [signed and notarized](/post/notarized/). Also check the [todo list](/post/todo/) for an up to date status.

The work on RsyncUI commenced in December 2020 and version 1.0.0 is close to release. The rc version 1.0.0 is released after about four months of work. The four last months also includes learning the basics about SwiftUI and Combine frameworks. And there is still a lot to learn. RsyncUI is reusing a lot of the model classes from RsyncOSX. There has been some minor refactor av the model classes due to utilizing Combine and adaption to RsyncUI.

I think RsyncUI is ready to be released. There is still work to do, but that will be included in future releases. The future of RsyncOSX is RsyncUI and RsyncSchedule, the menu app. I have for the moment some ideas for the future development:

- develop a Sandboxed version of RsyncUI for release on the Apple App Store
- develop the RsyncOSXsched, the menu app, utilizing SwiftUI
- integrate more of Combine in all apps

I also believe that by releasing RsyncUI will result in users asking for fixing bugs and enhancements for functions and the UI.

## Update 2 May 2021

The **snapshot administration**, like delete old snapshots, is not yet completed. The work on snapshot administration is going forward and it will be released as part of version 1.0.0 of RsyncUI. But there are a few issues which has to be resolved before release.

The function for **delete snapshots** is not available in the release candidate.

## Prerelease version 0.99(build 22) - release candidate version 1.0.0

There is 28 April 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) a release candidate of RsyncUI and RsyncSchedule, the menu app for executing scheduled tasks.

The following are changes compared to previous release:

- German and Norwegian localization is completed
- more use of the Combine framework
- split two "busy" UIs into two views, schedules and rsync parameters
- some minor tweaks in preparation for release of version 1.0.0

**Caution**: RsyncUI can be used in **parallel with RsyncOSX**. But that requires **RsyncOSX** to be setup to use JSON files and that the files for permanent storage is in the same catalog as RsyncUI. RsyncUI and RsyncOSX does **not** share the user settings.

There is some more info about [how to setup RsyncOSX utilizing JSON](https://rsyncosx.netlify.app/post/json/). The `About` for both RsyncOSX and RsyncUI shows in bottom of view, where the data is saved. Default catalog for storing files for both apps is:

```
$HOME/.rsyncosx/macserialnumber/
```
