The prerelease is a version **for test and preview of what is coming**. It is work in progress and bugs might occur. RsyncUI is [signed and notarized](/post/notarized/).

---

The prerelease v036(build 10) is now very close, by functions, to the current release of RsyncOSX. But it is still in development and bugs might occur. There are still some major functions missing, but the gap is closing. Also check the [todo list](/post/todo/) for an up to date status.
