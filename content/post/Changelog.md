The prerelease is a version **for test and preview of what is coming**. It is work in progress and bugs might occur. RsyncUI is [signed and notarized](/post/notarized/).

The prerelease v0.47(build 16) is close, by functions, to the current release of RsyncOSX. But it is still in development and bugs might occur. There are still a few major functions missing, but the gap is closing. Also check the [todo list](/post/todo/) for an up to date status.
