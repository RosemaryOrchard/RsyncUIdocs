RsyncUI is a SwiftUI based GUI on top of the command line utility `rsync` which is a file based tool for synchronization of files. RsyncUI is [signed and notarized](/post/notarized/) and built as [Universal macOS Binary](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building_a_universal_macos_binary).

- RsyncUI is built with support for **macOS Monterey**
- the latest [release for download](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases)

The first time RsyncUI is started the Welcome message is presented. Please read the info and when ready to add tasks select the Dismiss button which opens the [add a configuration](/post/addconfigurations/) view. Before commencing use of RsyncOSX there are a few [important words to read](/post/important/).

## The changelog

There is a [changelog](/post/changelog/). Also please see info about [the latest version of rsync](/post/rsync/) to install.

RsyncUI can be used in **parallel with RsyncOSX**. Default catalog for storing configuration files is:

```bash
$HOME/.rsyncosx/macserialnumber/
```
RsyncUI and RsyncOSX **does not** share the user settings, e.g like enabling version 3.x of rsync has to be set in both apps.

- by [ssh-keys](/post/ssh/)
- by [rsync daemon setup](/post/rsyncdaemon/)
