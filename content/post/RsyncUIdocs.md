This is the documentation of the new app RsyncUI, the next and future release of RsyncOSX. My main focus after releasing RsyncUI will be to enhance and continue the development of it. There will also later this year, be developed a Sandboxed version for release on Apple Mac Store . And there will also be a menu app for executing scheduled tasks.

For the moment the development of current version of RsyncOSX and RsyncOSXsched (the menu app) is frozen. Both apps are stable and only critical bugs will be fixed. Both apps will be avaliable for download in the future, probably to end of 2022. The main focus now is the release of [RsyncUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI) and [RsyncSchedule](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncSchedule).

The documentation will be updated as the development is going forward. The prerelease is a version for **test** and **preview** of what is coming. It is work in progress and bugs might occur.

There is a [changelog](/post/changelog/) and a [todo list](/post/todo/), please check both before commencing the use of the prerelease.

- RsyncUI and RsyncSchedule are compiled with support for **macOS Big Sur** and later
- the latest [release for download](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases)

RsyncUI is [signed and notarized](/post/notarized/) and built as [Universal macOS Binary](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building_a_universal_macos_binary).

## Using RsyncUI

This section is about using RsyncUI. RsyncUI can be used in **parallel with RsyncOSX**. But that requires RsyncOSX to be setup to use JSON files and that the files for permanent storage is in the same catalog. RsyncUI and RsyncOSX does **not** share the settings. There is some more info about how to [setup RsyncOSX utilizing JSON](https://rsyncosx.netlify.app/post/json/).

The `About` for both RsyncOSX and RsyncUI shows in bottom of view, where the data is saved.

### The main menu

The default view when starting the app. RsyncUI can store configurations in profiles. Select a profile at any time and the app reloads the data.

The documented screenshots may be slightly different from what is in the current prerelease. There is now frequent minor tweaks and changes to the UI. The documentation will be updated with the latest screenshots **after** release 1.0.0 in May 2021.

### How to setup remote servers

Utilizing RsyncUI to synchronize files to remote servers requires setup of remote connection as [passwordless logins](/post/remotelogins/). There are two options for setup. The advised setup is by utilizing ssh-keys.

- [setup by ssh-keys](/post/ssh/)
- [rsync daemon setup](/post/rsyncdaemon/)

Snapshot is **not** possible with rsync daemon setup.

### How to add and update

It is easy to [add a configuration](/post/addconfigurations/) and execute your first synchronize task.

### RsyncUI settings

The user can [tweak some settings in RsyncUI](/post/settings/)

### Execute tasks

How to execute tasks, either multiple tasks, single task or just a quick task.

- [executing multiple tasks](/post/multipletasks/)
- [executing a single task](/post/singletask/)
- [execute quick task](/post/quicktask/)

### Pre and post task

RsyncUI might [execute a pre- and post shell script](/post/shellout/) connected to a task.

### Restore data

Sometimes you might want to [restore some data](/post/restore/).

### Parameters to rsync

Rsync has a ton of parameters. In [user selected parameters](/post/rsyncparameters) you can add your own additional parameters to rsync. There is also a set of default rsync parameters.

### Verify the synchronized data

Rsync can also [verify the synchronized data](/post/verify/).

### Logging of runs

 [The logredcods](/post/logging/) can be viewed either all or by config.

### Logfile

The `âŒ˜L` shortcut brings up any logging to file. Sometimes `rsync` produces error and output are saved to the logfile for viewing and possible corrections of the task. If `rsync` produces an error RsyncUI will inform about that.
