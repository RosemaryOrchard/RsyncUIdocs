There are a few settings to be tweaked. Settings are saved to permanent store. The settings are dividede into three parts. When the user has changed a setting it is marked with a change on the `Save` button. The Save button is disabled until a change has happend.

Usersettings might be opened by the default `âŒ˜,` shortcut for settings.

- [Settings](/post/normalsettings/) - rsync and other settings
- [Ssh](/post/sshsettings) - SSH settings
- [Environment](/post/environment/) - environment settings

The info tab shows which version of rsync in use and the path for storing and reading configurations to permanent store.
