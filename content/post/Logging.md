Logging in RsyncUI might be switched on/off in user configuration. The log records are by default sorted with most recent ontop. Log records can be **filtered** by **any strings** by search field.

Log records can be selected for delete:
- either one by one
- or by filter and all
- or all logs

Below are three samples of filter:

## All logs

By date:

![](/images/log/logalldate.png)

By text in logs:

![](/images/log/logallfiles.png)

## By configuration

![](/images/log/logbyconfig.png)
