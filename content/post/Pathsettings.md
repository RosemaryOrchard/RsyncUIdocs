## Paths for RsyncUI and RsyncOSXsched

If both apps are installed in `/Applications` there is no need for setting paths.

- path RsyncUI
- path RsyncOSXsched

## Environment

Enable environment:

It is possible to enter an environment variable to the process which executes the synchronize task. An example of such is :

`"SSH_AUTH_SOCK": "/Users/username/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh"`
