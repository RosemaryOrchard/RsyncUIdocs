The multiple tasks view will probably be the most used view after adding the tasks. The info in this view is still in development.

## The buttons:

The following actions within this view:

- `All` - execute all tasks, no estimation just execute all tasks
- `Select` - select tasks for either estimate and execute, or just execute
- `Estimate` - estimate all tasks, select tasks with data for synchronizing
- `Execute` - execute selected and estimated tasks

- `View` - after estimaten, view result
- `Delete` - select a task for delete
- `Abort` - abort the ongoing task
