The multiple tasks view will probably be the most used view after adding the tasks. Select the `Estimate` button and let RsyncUI find all tasks with data to be synchcronized. After estimating select `Execute` for the actual synchronize of data for tasks with new data.

You can also select one or more task, or just execute all tasks by the `All` button.

To delete one or more task, select and `Delete`.

The following actions are possible within this view:

- `All` - execute all tasks, no estimation just execute all tasks
- `Select` - select tasks for either estimate and execute, or just execute
- `Estimate` - estimate all tasks, select tasks with data for synchronizing
- `Execute` - execute selected and estimated tasks

The buttons to right:

- `View` - after estimaten, view result
- `Delete` - select a task for delete
- `Abort` - abort the ongoing task
