*Under development.* This page is an overview of the main components of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI. The development of the apps has been an evolving process. The open source community has been and still is a great resource for ideas and how to solve specific tasks. Both apps today are stable and in a state of maintenance.

Some numbers:

| App      | Lines of code | Swift files | Version 1.0 |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- | -------- |
| RsyncUI   | about 14K     | about 170       | 6 May 2021 |
| RsyncOSX   | about 11K   | about 120      | 14 March 2016 |	

Which application to use? Both applications do the same job. They read and update the same files for tasks and logs which means you can use both apps, but not at the same time due to locking of files. 

## A few words about the code

Even though I am an educated IT person, most of my professional work has been as an IT manager and not a developer. Most of my coding experience is with private projects such as RsyncOSX and RsyncUI. Google is and has been a great resource for research and advice on how to solve specific problems. Reading other developers' code and discussing it is always valuable input for my code. The MVC pattern and single source of truth are important patterns for both apps. I have also tried to use all Apple Frameworks, utilising most of the required built-in functions, like sorting or filter algorithms. And even if there are many lines of code in both apps, I have tried to write as little code as possible. So if you are looking at my code, keep this in mind: my code is only one of probably many ways to solve a problem.

## RsyncOSX vs RsyncUI

For the moment, there are more users of RsyncOSX than RsyncUI. But the number of users of RsyncUI is growing. And Apple is clear: SwiftUI, which RsyncUI is developed by, is the future. This means that most of my development is now on RsyncUI. RsyncOSX is still supported, but only issues are fixed and no new features are added. RsyncUI and RsyncOSX share most of the code for the model components. The main differences between the two apps are the user interface (UI) and how the UI is built. RsyncUI is developed using SwiftUI. RsyncOSX is developed using storyboards. Both apps utilise another great declarative library, Combine, developed by Apple, and JSON files for storing tasks, log records, and user configuration.

| App      | Code | Paradigm |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- |
| RsyncUI   | SwiftUI, Swift | declarativ  |
| RsyncOSX   | Storyboard, Swift  | imperativ |

SwiftUI is the latest declarative framework developed by Apple for views, controls, and layout structures for user interface. 

### RsyncUI, SwiftUI

*RsyncUI* utilizes *SwiftUI* for the UI. UI components are views, which is a value type `struct` and not a reference type `class`. UI components are added to RsyncUI by code. Every time a property within a SwiftUI view is changed the view is recreated by the runtime. In SwitfUI there are property wrappers to create bindings to mutable properties.

### RsyncOSX, Storyboard

*RsyncOSX* utilizes *Storyboard*, which is a tool for graphical design of views. UI components like buttons, tables and other UI components are added and placed within the view by the developer utilizing Xcode. After design all UI components are connected by creating bindings to Swift code. The developer manually adds a reference to the Swift source code for every view  within the Storyboard. If the developer misses to bind a UI component, the app will crash with an nil pointer exception every time that view is exposed.

Storyboard for the tab views:
{{< figure src="/images/Xcode/storyboard1.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Storyboard for the sheetviews:
{{< figure src="/images/Xcode/storyboard2.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

## Asynchronous execution 

Asynchronous execution of tasks are key components of both apps. Every time a `rsync` synchronize and restore task is executed the termination of the task is not known ahead.  When the *termination signal* is observed some actions are required. Some actions are like stopping a progressview, send a message about task is completed, do some logging and execute next synchronize task.

There are two methods for asynchronous execution. One is utilizing *callback functions* or *completion handlers*, which trigger next action when task is completed. The second is utilize SwiftÂ´s `async` and `await` utilities for asynchronous execution. Utilizing `async` and `await` makes the code simpler and cleaner. The need for *completion handlers* are reduced.  And lesser code is better code. Swift concurrency is a seperate and huge topic to discuss. I am not in a position to discuss it. There are structured and unstructered concurrency in Swift. Within RsyncUI and RsyncOSX there are only one asynchronous execution at any time except for concurrency within the Swift and SwiftUI libraries such as GUI updates. 

All code which utilizes asynchronous execution are shared between the two apps. The `Process` object is where the real work is done. Input to the `Process` are the command to execute and the parameters for the command. The `Process` object utilizes Combine for monitoring *process termination* and output, when needed by the apps, from the command.  There are two versions of the process object:

- [the process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Process/Main/RsyncProcess.swift)
- [the async process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Process/Main/Async/RsyncProcessAsync.swift)

The difference between those two objects are minor, the async version marks the function for execution with keyword `async`. Calling the `async` require the `await` keyword. 

## Combine

Combine, a *declarative* library by Apple, makes the code easy to write and easy to read. In the Combine code for encode and write data to JSON file, the publisher require *macOS BigSur* and later. The following are examples of utilizing Combine:

- [read](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Storage/ReadConfigurationJSON.swift) configurations for tasks
- [write](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Storage/WriteConfigurationJSON.swift) configurations for tasks
- [the process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Process/Main/Async/RsyncProcessAsync.swift) for executing tasks

## Start of RsyncOSX

The start of RsyncOSX starts with the attribute `@NSApplicationMain` which kicks off everything. Within the Storyboard, the entry point is marked, and the view is binded with the Switf code to start the application. The Toolbar is programmatically constructed, which makes it easier to change vs. designing it on the Storyboard.

## Start of RsyncUI

The start of RsyncUI conforms to the [App protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/App). There is only one entrance point, `@main`, in RsyncUI. The `@main` initialises the app, setup of the menubar, and opens the navigation bar which is the main user start for the app.

# The model

Parts of the model is equal, but there are some differences due to the fact that SwiftUI views are value types (structs) and not reference types (classes) as in Storyboard and Swift. The model is also responsible for informing the views when there are changes. Both apps share basic functions like reading and writing data from the store, updating the model, and so on. The memory footprint of tasks is minimal. Data for tasks are kept in memory for both apps during their lifetime. The memory footprint for logs will grow over time as new logs are created and stored. But logs are only read from the store when viewing and deleting logs. When data about logs is not used, the data is released from memory to keep the memory as low as possible.

# SwiftUI

The following are for RsyncUI and SwiftUI.

## Property wrapper for objects

With Swift 5.9, Xcode 15 and macOS 14 Apple introduced the `Observable` macro. On previous macOS versions, the property wrapper `@StateObject` in combination with `ObservableObject` and Combine, are used to create binding to mutable properties. The new macro simplifies how to create bindings and there is also quite a boost in performance. The performance part is not that important for RsyncUI, but lesser code is better code.  There is also a new `@Bindable` property wrapper which create bindings to mutable properties of `Observable` objects. 

## Environment property

Data for tasks are read from store and made available for all the views by an Environment property. After the app is initialized and started, it opens the main navigation and read tasks for the default profile and other profiles when selected. Data for tasks is made available for all views  within the view hierarchy by the `.environment` property on *macOS Sonoma* and  by the `.environmentObject` property on *macOS Ventura* and *Monterey*. The property makes the data global available for all views. The `@Bindable` property wrapper is also, on macOS Sonoma, used for create bindings.

All synchronize tasks are executed asynchron. The process object, which is responsible for executing the external rsync tasks, is listening for termination of the external process.  A `StateObject` or `State` on macOS Sonoma, which is created when the SwiftUI view for observing the progress is created, is by the model updated during progress of the task.
