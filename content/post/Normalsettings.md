You can any time save the current configuration files by the `Backup` button. The backup button executes a copy of all configuration files into your Documents catalog and postfixes the copy with a timestamp `-month-day-year/hour/minute`.

`$HOME/Documents/RsyncUIcopy-05-06-2021/08/21`

**Caution**: when opening the catalog it might be seen as empty. The copy is a `.catalog` and your filebrowser might not see such catalogs.

## Rsync version and path

It is adviced to install rsync as part of Homebrew. RsyncUI discover what type of Mac you are on. The path for Homebrew on the Intel based Mac is: `/usr/local/bin` and on the Apple Silicon: `/opt/homebrew/bin`.

 - Rsync v3.x to `on` - set optional path if **NOT** by Homebrew
   	- any version of rsync should work, but only version 2.6.9 and 3.2.x are tested and verified
    - [utilizing the snapshot feature](/post/snapshots/) require version 3.2.x of rsync
- path for rsync:
    - if utilized version of rsync is **not** installed by Homebrew set path to rsync
- path for restore:
    - preset temporary path for restoring single files and catalogs
    - preset temporary path for a full restore

If there is a not valid rsync path is set an error is presented.

## Log to file

There is three choices for logging, none, min and full and they are mutually exclusive. The following are settings for logging:

- none - there is no logging
- min - last 10 lines of output is logged
- full - everything is logged

The log file can be inspected by `âŒ˜O` shortcut or by the File menu. The log file is stored at `$HOME/.rsyncosx/macserial/rsynclog.txt`.

## Level log

If Detailed is `on` there is a separate log for each run. If `off` only date for last run is saved on the configuration.

## Mark days

Tasks with older execute date than number of days are marked red.

## Monitor network

RsyncUI can monitor the network connection during execution of tasks. If a network connection is dropped during execution, RsyncUI sends an interrupt signal to the task and it halts with an error.

## Check input

By setting check data, RsyncUI will check and if required clean logs. The check data flag is **not** persistent and have to be set each time.
